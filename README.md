# vCenterControlFile
Utility for building a vCenter control file for use in schedule tasks or other automated methods to allow vCenter actions to run under different context

Some of my scripts are designed to either run as another user directly, for example allowing some helpdesk function without granted users access to vCenter itself, or for running reports, audits etc. from a Windows Task Scheduler using a service account.
